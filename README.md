# **Final Capstone**
This project contains three key tasks made in the finale of completing the Data Science Bootcamp by HyperionDev. 

##**Capstone Project MINST**

For this project I used the House numbers dataset from Stanford University (http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers). 
This dataset contains images of house numbers taken from Google Street View, each cropped to be 32×32 pixels large, and centered on one number only.
I used train, development and test sets to generate RandomForestClassifiers and showed the affect tuning max_depth had on accuracy.
A colourmap demonstrates which class the model struggles with the most and the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score are reported.

##**Capstone Project US.Arrests**
This dataset come from the Kaggle Challenge described as, “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents,
for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the
percent of the population living in urban areas.”

In this project I explore how different US states differ in arrest due to assault, murder, population living in urban areas and rape, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various clustering techniques. 


##**Capsstone BookStore Clerk**
I created a program that can be used to add new books to the database, update book information, delete books from the database and search the database to find a specific book.
This is a simple tool to help a programmer who need to organise a catalogue of some sort, mainly it has been designed for a bookstore clerk.
